                    as the Ateneo de Manila or the Ateneo, is a private, Catholic research university and basic <br>
                    education institution in Quezon City, Philippines. <br>
                    Ateneo de Manila began in 1859 when Spanish Jesuits established the Escuela Municipal de Manila, <br>
                     a public primary school established in Intramuros for the city of Manila. However, Ateneo's educational <br>
                      tradition embraces the much older history of the Jesuits as a teaching order in the Philippines.
                </p>
                <p>- Ateneo education draws from the Jesuit tradition of faith and justice, character <br>
                     formation, openness and discernment, that provides a foundation for technical competence, <br>
                      leadership and a deep commitment to global human development.</p>
                      <p> - Ateneo de Manila University, located in the Philippines, is known for its strong academic programs, <br>
                         particularly in the fields of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, business, and law <br>
                         It offers professional degrees through the Graduate School of Business, the School of Government, <br>
                         the School of Medicine and Public Health, and the Ateneo Law School. Known for its Jesuit liberal arts tradition, <br>
                         the humanities are a key feature of Ateneo education at all levels of study</p>
                         <p>
                            Ateneo de Manila University continues its run as the top Philippine institution in the latest edition of the Times <br>
                             Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings. Ateneo came in the 1001-1200 bracket of the 2024 THE WUR, <br>
                              a significant change from the institution's debut at the 351-400 bracket the previous year.
